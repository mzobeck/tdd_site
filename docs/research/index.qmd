### Initial von Willebrand factor antigen values in adolescent females predict future values.

![](vwf_fig.jpg){fig-align="center" width="476"}

**TL;DR:** We modeled future von Willebrand Factor (VWF) levels based on previous VWF levels and other covariates to describe a decision threshold for retesting for von Willebrand disease (VWD) in adolescent females. We found that for an initial level of 80%, there was around an 8% chance the patient could still be found to have VWD, and at an initial level of 90%, there was around a 3% chance of VWD on retesting. These findings can help physicians decide who and when to retest for VWD. I made the above graph and find it quite pleasing.

### Novel and replicated clinical and genetic risk factors for toxicity from high-dose methotrexate in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia

![](mtx_megapape.jpg){fig-align="center"}

**TL;DR:** We described single nucleotide polymorphisms that were associated with creatinine increased after high-dose methotrexate or with delayed methotrexate clearance. Some of these associations had not been previously described, others replicated previous findings (a rarity in the pharmacogenomics literature!). This project advance our understanding of who is at most risk for methotrexate toxicity and will hopefully help with the development of strategies to avoid toxicities before they develop. I made the above graphics for the paper and really like style.

### **Novel risk factors for glucarpidase use in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia: Hispanic ethnicity, age, and the ABCC4 gene**

![](glucarpidase.jpg){fig-align="center" width="282"}

**TL;DR:** We described single nucleotide polymorphisms that were associated with nephrotoxicty from high-dose methotrexate that was severe enough to require glucarpidase, an extremely expensive drug that helps us avoid kidney failure from methotrexate. We found a novel association between a variant in the *ABCC4* gene and requiring glucarpidase (this association was reproduced in the other methotrexate study above). We also found that Hispanic patients are at *much* higher risk for requiring glucarpidase compared to non-Hispanic patients, an association we are still trying to unravel.

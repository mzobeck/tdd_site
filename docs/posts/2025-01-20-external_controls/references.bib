	abstract = {A randomized clinical trial ({RCT}) is frequently the preferred research design for testing new medical treatments. Randomization helps to ensure that the participants in the treatment groups are similar in the distribution of prognostic factors. This minimizes bias in statistical comparisons of patient outcomes and allows differences to be interpreted as the causal effect of treatment assigment. However, there are situations in which randomizing participants to a control treatment or placebo within an {RCT} may not be practical or ethical, eg, if a comparison with placebo is desired but an effective treatment already exists. In such cases, researchers might use data from participants who had received the intended control treatment in a prior study, termed historical controls, to estimate the benefit of the new treatment.},

	shorttitle = {The use of external controls},
	abstract = {With more and better clinical data being captured outside of clinical studies and greater data sharing of clinical studies, external controls may become a more attractive alternative to randomized clinical trials ({RCTs}). Both industry and regulators recognize that in situations where a randomized study cannot be performed, external controls can provide the needed contextualization to allow a better interpretation of studies without a randomized control. It is also agreed that external controls will not fully replace {RCTs} as the gold standard for formal proof of efficacy in drug development and the yardstick of clinical research. However, it remains unclear in which situations conclusions about efficacy and a positive benefit/risk can reliably be based on the use of an external control. This paper will provide an overview on types of external control, their applications and the different sources of bias their use may incur, and discuss potential mitigation steps. It will also give recommendations on how the use of external controls can be justified.},

	abstract = {Although randomized control trials allow for a comparison of treatment arms with minimal concern for confounding by known and unknown factors, a randomized study is not feasible in certain disease settings. When a randomized design is not possible, incorporating external control data into the study design can be an effective way to expand the interpretability of the results of an experimental arm by introducing the ability to carry out a formal or an informal comparative analysis. This paper provides an introduction to the concepts of external controls in oncology trials, followed by a review of relevant and current research on this topic. The paper also focuses on general considerations for designing a trial that may incorporate external control data, followed by case studies of the marketing applications submitted to the Food and Drug Administration that included external control data.},

	abstract = {Drug development in oncology has broadened from mainly considering randomized clinical trials to also including single‐arm trials tailored for very specific subtypes of cancer. They often use historical controls, and this article discusses benefits and risks of this paradigm and provide various regulatory and statistical considerations. While leveraging the information brought by historical controls could potentially shorten development time and reduce the number of patients enrolled, a careful selection of the past studies, a prespecified statistical analysis accounting for the heterogeneity between studies, and early engagement with regulators will be key to success. Although both the European Medicines Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have already approved medicines based on nonrandomized experiments, the evidentiary package can be perceived as less comprehensive than randomized experiments. Use of historical controls, therefore, is better suited for cases of high unmet clinical need, where the disease course is well characterized and the primary endpoint is objective.Incorporating historical data in single‐arm oncology trials has the potential to accelerate drug development and to reduce the number of patients enrolled, compared with standard randomized controlled clinical trials. Given the lack of blinding and randomization, such an approach is better suited for cases of high unmet clinical need and/or difficult experimental situations, in which the trajectory of the disease is well characterized and the endpoint can be measured objectively. Careful pre‐specification and selection of the historical data, matching of the patient characteristics with the concurrent trial data, and innovative statistical methodologies accounting for between‐study variation will be needed. Early engagement with regulators (e.g., via Scientific Advice) is highly recommended.},

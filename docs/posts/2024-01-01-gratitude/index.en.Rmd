## The contentification of life 

The world is increasingly filled with noise and nonsense, making it
difficult to see what is valuable amid a torrent of trivialities. With
the rise of social media, our attention has been turned into an economic
commodity. Four million new posts are made on Instagram every hour; 3.7
million new YouTube videos are uploaded every day. This is chump change
compared to what's coming. The rate of content production is going to
increase exponentially as generative AI matures in consumer
applications. And the contentification of the internet for the
commodification of our attention has overflowed into the offline world.
Everywhere we turn we're offered the chance to level up in our jobs, our
relationships, our skills, or our goals (and on Facebook for me, level
up my hip mobility because I clicked on an ad about stretching once).
There's always more to see, more to learn, and more to do to maximize
the moment and optimize our happiness. Almost all of this is a heap of
rubbish. Yet there are always small buried treasures that keep us coming
back to rummage through the garbage.

## The exponentiation of life 

Beyond the value of the content we produce, the speed of production also
gives us heartburn. We humans, evolved in the cradle of the natural
numbers, nourished as a species by the small positive integers that we
found on our fingers and our toes, have difficulty handling the
exponentiation of possible human experiences. There are so many things
we could do. So many ways to spend our time. So many counterfactual
worlds unfolding at ever increasing speeds ahead of us. Navigating life
is increasingly complex, increasingly overwhelming. Our attention can't
handle it all.

## Many options that mostly stink 

So we have tons of ways we could spend our time, energy and attention.
Too many. Most of these options are garbage. But it's hard to tell
upfront what is worthless and what is valuable because attention is
money so everything is marketing. Everything has a new coat of paint and
has been spritzed with perfume. What do we do when there are so many
things we could do, but it's hard to tell which are wastes of time? How
do we reduce the dimensionality of our options with so much noisy data?
Gratitude can help Gratitude can help us focus on what is valuable.
Being grateful for something implies a host of magnificent and healthy
epistemic processes. For example, I'm grateful for my dog, Rosie. I'm
particularly grateful that she's acting less like a puppy and more like
a productive member of my family's household society. To tell you about
my gratitude for my dog's behavior, I had to first search through all
sorts of things in my life I could tell you about. Rosie was easy to
find in this search process. However the algorithm works, it was
efficient and accurate - it didn't take me long to come up with an
example and I'm certain about my feeling here. To articulate my
gratitude, I then had to particularize Rosie as an object of my
attention. Rosie is not an abstract concept or just an idea. She became
an object in my attention with properties and characteristics that I can
describe. In other words, I focused on her to the exclusion of anything
else. Once presented in my awareness, my relationship with her takes
center stage. I'm grateful for her because of how we interact. Not just
because of who she is or who I am, but because of who we are together.
We're correlated statistically. What I think is associated with who she
is. We're coupled cybernetically. How she exists influences what I do.
My gratitude is about our existence together - a dynamic, fluid,
abstract-yet-influential relationship that helps to direct my
experiences and actions over time.

## Gratitude as signal of value 

Rosie has helped me find what is valuable. My gratitude acted as both
search and filter for finding something that has meaning to me. Easy,
quick, accurate. It doesn't matter how many more things I add to search
through, how much more content humanity produces, it will still be easy
to identify her - and a host of other good things in my life - as
something I'm grateful for. This salience in my focus, this worthiness
of attention that gratitude produces is something I can only describe as
meaningful. It fills that epistemic moment with a sense of value.
Gratitude helps us find the signals of value in the noise of modern
life.

## Gratitude as dimensionality reduction

To be grateful for Rosie, I also had to focus on her at the exclusion of
anything else. There are many, perhaps uncountably infinite, things I
could be grateful for. There are also many, perhaps uncountably
infinite, ways that I could be grateful for Rosie. Relationships are
dynamic, they change in quality over time. But from all of these
possibilities, I could wrap my attention around a thing known as Rosie
and describe her in a way that is comprehensible to you in just a few
words. I could envelop the intricate complexities of our relationship,
an immaterial thing, to communicate the positive experience I take from
it. Considering how Rosie and I can move through life together, there
are yet infinitely more ways that we could act and interact, and yet my
gratitude at where we've been suggest possible futures that are valuable
and that would make me grateful anew. In sea of infinite options,
gratitude has reduce the dimensions I must consider to help me reflect
on where I've been and chart a course for the future.

## Gratitude in 2024 

This has been a meditation on part of life I find overwhelming. I want
to do good stuff. I want to be good at the things I do. I want to have
meaningful relationships. I want to live my life well. Many and more are
the ways this could happen or could go wrong. There are so many dang
options for how to spend my time. I'm extremely grateful for my dog,
obviously, as well as my family, friends, job, and God. Gratitude helps
me slow down, find those things that are meaningful, and savor the good
dynamics of those relationships. It also helps me to think about how to
nourish those good things so they bloom into something beautiful. Being
grateful for what I've experience in 2023 helps me plan what to do in
2024. I have goals, but gratitude suggests the purpose isn't to achieve
goals, it's to help what is true, beautiful, and good in my life
flourish.

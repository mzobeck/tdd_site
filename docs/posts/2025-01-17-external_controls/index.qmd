## Introduction

External controls are, for better or worse, common in pediatric oncology
clinical trials. I don’t love them. They are dangerous. However, there
are arguments in their favor. In this post, I’ll briefly discuss what
historical controls are, when their use might be justified, and why
they’re dangerous.

## What are external controls?

The purpose of clinical trials is to evaluate the effect of a treatment
in some population of patients. In a classic randomized clinical trial,
patients who meet the study criteria are randomized to either receive
the standard of care for their disease or a new treatment. The outcome
between the two groups is compared, and due to the miracle of
randomization, the treatment effect can be identified as the difference
in the outcomes between the groups.

External controls are a group of patients not enrolled in a clinical
trial but used as a comparison group for patients on a trial. The
difference between the outcomes for the controls and the treatment group
is taken as the effect of treatment, much like the comparison with the
standard of care arm in a clinical trial. For valid comparisons, the
control group should look as similar as possible to those that could
have been enrolled in the trial. The group may be taken from a previous
clinical trial, a patient registry, or other real-world data source. The
key limitation of this design is that external controls do not benefit
from the wonders of randomization, which makes bias a much greater
danger when estimating the effect of treatment.

## Why we might use external controls

External controls are generally used when trialists cannot or should not
enroll a comparison group for ethical reasons or because the disease is
so rare. Below is a table briefly explaining three reasons that might
justifying using external controls. I wouldn’t go so far as to call
these *good* reasons, but perhaps they are permissible
[@marion_use_2023].

### Permissible reasons

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **When Randomization to Placebo is Unethical**<br> In condition has with well-established, effective treatments, then randomizing patients to receive a placebo would be unethical. If investigators wish to measure the effect compared to no treatment then they may opt for an external control. |
| **Rare Disease Research**<br>Rare diseases make it difficult to recruit sufficient numbers of participants to meet the power requirements for a trial. External controls may be used to reduce the size of the trial.                                                                               |
| **Severe Outcomes or Vulnerable Populations**<br> Randomization may be viewed as unacceptable for diseases with particularly severe outcomes (e.g. terminal illness) or that affect vulnerable populations (e.g. children) even if there is no standard of care.                                    |

@collignon_implementing_2021 sums up the use cases for historical
(external) controls in their conclusion:

> The use of historical controls, therefore, is better suited for cases
> of high unmet clinical need, where the disease course is well
> characterized and the primary endpoint is objective.

### Suspect reasons

There are also many suspicious reasons for using external control. One
is that they reduce the time and costs associated with conducting a
trial. The problem with this reasoning is that the savings may be
minimal. Enrolling 200 patients in a trial compared to 400 patients does
not reduce the budget by half, given the enormous fixed costs associated
with designing and opening trials. No matter how many patients are
enrolled, the trial may have to be run for the same time when outcomes
are measured over years, as with survival in oncology trials. While
external controls might suggest savings, the benefits are not as
advertised.

More importantly, there is an enormous price to pay for the credibility
of the trial’s results. Many sources of bias can confound the treatment
effect and make clear conclusions impossible. A trial may go on for ten
years only to end in a collective, scientific shrug ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

## Sources of bias from external controls

External control’s fundamental problem is that they are not randomized,
leaving many ways that they can introduce bias into the analysis.
Randomization reveals a treatment effect by guaranteeing that only
random chance determines which treatment patients receive. This ensures
no residual confounding between treatment and the outcome of interest.
In the parlance of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), randomization erases
all back door paths between the treatment and the outcome. No such
guarantees exist for external controls, and backdoor paths very likely
exist between treatment and outcomes. I’ve drawn the DAG below to
represent the essential structure of the problem. There are many other
more complex structures, but I find this to be a sufficient
representation of the basic concerns.

```{r dg-single-dag}
#| echo: false
DiagrammeR::grViz("
  digraph mrdag {
    graph [rankdir=TB]

    # Node definitions
    node [shape=ellipse]
    U [label='Patient Group']
    X [label='Treatment']
    Y [label='Outcome']
    { rank = same; X Y }

    # Edges
    U -> X
    U -> Y
    X -> Y [minlen=3]
  }
", height = 200)
```

One example of how patient groups could affect treatment and outcome is
if the external control group is drawn from a registry of sicker and
older patients who tend to have worse outcomes than the group in the
trial that received the treatment. This situation could make the
treatment appear more effective than it truly is. There are many other
sources of bias. The table below \[adapted from [@burger_use_2021]\],
lists some of the main sources of bias and how to mitigate their effect.

## How to reduce bias when using external controls

The best way to reduce bias from external controls is an open area of
research. This is a polite way of saying it’s complicated and a mess.
It’s complicated because these studies are not quite observational
studies, but they definitely aren’t randomized trials. Researchers have,
therefore, opted for a range of analytical techniques, including using
thresholds, propensity scores, matching, and meta-analytic methods. A
full discussion of analytical options is outside the scope of this blog
post, but see the references at the end for more. Regardless of the
method used, the most important way to control bias is undoubtedly to
select an external control group that is a close comparison to the types
of patients enrolled in the trial.

Analyzing data from these types of studies is also a mess because many
untoward motivations can sneak into the results. These studies can be
used to justify regulatory approval for a drug or biomedical device.
Companies are motivated to represent their product in the best way
possible because there is a pot of gold at the end of the quest for
regulatory approval. Mixing a company’s profit margins with a high
dimensional vector of bias sources and a flexible choice of analytical
techniques is a recipe for chaos.

## Conclusion

I think it’s possible to justify the use of external controls and glean
useful information from them in certain settings. Regulators have even
begun to admit them as evidence to justifty drug approval \[see
[@mishra-kalyani_external_2022] for examples\]. But I also think it’s a
generally rational policy to increase one’s skepticism about a study in
proportion to the number of free researcher degrees of freedom with an
additional adjustment for the presence of motivated reasoning. Both are
present in abundance with external controls. So, it makes good sense to
bring a strong scientific skepticism to these studies. In this blog,
we’ve outlined the many ways that bias influences their results. The
burden of proof – a rightfully heavy one – should rest on the
investigators to demonstrate their study design and analysis overcome
the many limitations of external controls.

### What is a dialectic?

> **Dī-ə-ˈlek-tik:** A method of examining and discussing opposing ideas in order to find the truth.

A dialectic is <span style="color:#0047AB;">**a conversation**</span> between people with opposing views who wish to find truth through reasoned arguments.

This is <span style="color:#0047AB;">**an ancient form of collective reasoning**</span>. Popularized by Socrates in 400 BC, it remains a crucial method for forming social consensus and driving scientific progress.

Amid the noise and nonsense of modern life, a thoughtful dialectic can help us <span style="color:#0047AB;">**discover truth and meaning**</span> in a time when both are increasingly difficult to find.

With\nthe rise of social media, our attention has become an economic\ncommodity. Four million new posts are made on Instagram every hour; 3.7\nmillion new YouTube videos are uploaded every day. This is chump change\ncompared to what's coming. The rate of content production is going to\nincrease exponentially as generative AI matures in consumer\napplications. And the contentification of the internet for the\ncommodification of our attention has overflowed into the offline world.\nEverywhere we turn, we're offered the chance to level up in our jobs,\nour relationships, our skills, or our goals (and on Facebook, for me,\nlevel up my hip mobility because I clicked on an ad about stretching\nonce). There's always more to see, more to learn, and more to do to\nmaximize the moment and optimize our happiness. Almost all of this is a\nheap of rubbish. Yet there are always small, buried treasures that keep\nus coming back to rummage through the garbage.\n\n## **The exponentiation of life**\n\nBeyond the value of the content we produce, the speed of production also\ngives us heartburn. We humans, evolved in the cradle of the natural\nnumbers, nourished as a species by the small positive integers that we\nfound on our fingers and our toes, have difficulty handling the\nexponentiation of possible human experiences. There are so many things\nwe could do. So many ways to spend our time. So many counterfactual\nworlds unfolding at ever increasing speeds ahead of us. Navigating life\nis increasingly complex, increasingly overwhelming. Our attention can't\nhandle it all.\n\n## **Many options that mostly stink**\n\nSo, we have tons of ways we could spend our time, energy, and attention.\nToo many. Most of these options are garbage. But it's hard to tell\nupfront what is worthless and what is valuable because attention is\nmoney, so everything is marketing. Everything has a new coat of paint\nand has been spritzed with perfume. What do we do when there are so many\nthings we could do, but it's hard to tell which are wastes of time? How\ndo we reduce the dimensionality of our options with so much noisy data?\n\n## **Gratitude can help**\n\nGratitude can help us focus on what is valuable. Being grateful for\nsomething implies a host of magnificent and healthy epistemic processes.\nFor example, I'm grateful for my dog, Rosie. I'm particularly grateful\nthat she's acting less like a puppy and more like a productive member of\nmy family's household society. To tell you about my gratitude for my\ndog's behavior, I had to first search through all sorts of things in my\nlife I could tell you about. Rosie was easy to find in this search\nprocess. However the algorithm works, it was efficient and accurate - it\ndidn't take me long to come up with an example and I'm certain about my\nfeeling here. To articulate my gratitude, I then had to particularize\nRosie as an object of my attention. Rosie is not an abstract concept or\njust an idea. She became an object of my attention with properties and\ncharacteristics that I can describe. In other words, I focused on her to\nthe exclusion of anything else. Once presented in my awareness, my\nrelationship with her takes center stage. I'm grateful for her because\nof how we interact. Not just because of who she is or who I am but\nbecause of who we are together. We're correlated statistically. What I\nthink is associated with who she is. We're coupled cybernetically. How\nshe exists influences what I do. My gratitude is about our existence\ntogether - a dynamic, fluid, abstract-yet-influential relationship that\nhelps to direct my experiences and actions over time.\n\n## **Gratitude as a signal of value**\n\nRosie has helped me find what is valuable. My gratitude acted as both\nsearch and filter for finding something that has meaning to me. Easy,\nquick, accurate. It doesn't matter how many more things I add to search\nthrough or how much more content humanity produces; it will still be\neasy to identify her - and a host of other good things in my life - as\nsomething I'm grateful for. This salience in my focus, this worthiness\nof attention that gratitude produces, is something I can only describe\nas meaningful. It fills that epistemic moment with a sense of value.\nGratitude helps us find the signals of value in the noise of modern\nlife.\n\n## **Gratitude as dimensionality reduction**\n\nTo be grateful for Rosie, I also had to focus on her to the exclusion of\nanything else. There are many, perhaps uncountably infinite, things I\ncould be grateful for. There are also many, perhaps uncountably\ninfinite, ways that I could be grateful for Rosie. Relationships are\ndynamic. They change in quality over time. But from all of these\npossibilities, I could wrap my attention around a thing known as Rosie\nand describe her in a way that is comprehensible to you in just a few\nwords. I could envelop the intricate complexities of our relationship,\nan immaterial thing, to communicate the positive experience I take from\nit. Considering how Rosie and I can move through life together, there\nare yet infinitely more ways that we could act and interact, and yet my\ngratitude at where we've been suggests possible futures that are\nvaluable and that would make me grateful anew. In a sea of infinite\noptions, gratitude has reduced the dimensions I must consider, helping\nme reflect on where I've been and chart a course for the future.\n\n## **Gratitude in 2024**\n\nThis has been a meditation on part of life I find overwhelming. I want\nto do good stuff. I want to be good at the things I do. I want to have\nmeaningful relationships. I want to live my life well. Many and more are\nthe ways this could happen or could go wrong. There are so many dang\noptions for how to spend my time. I'm extremely grateful for my dog,\nobviously, as well as my family, friends, job, and God. Gratitude helps\nme slow down, find those things that are meaningful, and savor the good\ndynamics of those relationships. It also helps me to think about how to\nnourish those good things so they bloom into something beautiful. Being\ngrateful for what I've experienced in 2023 helps me plan what to do in\n2024. I have goals, but gratitude suggests the purpose of planning isn't\nto achieve goals but to help what is true, beautiful, and good in my\nlife flourish.\n",

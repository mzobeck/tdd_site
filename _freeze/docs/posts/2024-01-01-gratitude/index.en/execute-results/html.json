With\nthe rise of social media, our attention has been turned into an economic\ncommodity. Four million new posts are made on Instagram every hour; 3.7\nmillion new YouTube videos are uploaded every day. This is chump change\ncompared to what's coming. The rate of content production is going to\nincrease exponentially as generative AI matures in consumer\napplications. And the contentification of the internet for the\ncommodification of our attention has overflowed into the offline world.\nEverywhere we turn we're offered the chance to level up in our jobs, our\nrelationships, our skills, or our goals (and on Facebook for me, level\nup my hip mobility because I clicked on an ad about stretching once).\nThere's always more to see, more to learn, and more to do to maximize\nthe moment and optimize our happiness. Almost all of this is a heap of\nrubbish. Yet there are always small buried treasures that keep us coming\nback to rummage through the garbage.\n\n## The exponentiation of life \n\nBeyond the value of the content we produce, the speed of production also\ngives us heartburn. We humans, evolved in the cradle of the natural\nnumbers, nourished as a species by the small positive integers that we\nfound on our fingers and our toes, have difficulty handling the\nexponentiation of possible human experiences. There are so many things\nwe could do. So many ways to spend our time. So many counterfactual\nworlds unfolding at ever increasing speeds ahead of us. Navigating life\nis increasingly complex, increasingly overwhelming. Our attention can't\nhandle it all.\n\n## Many options that mostly stink \n\nSo we have tons of ways we could spend our time, energy and attention.\nToo many. Most of these options are garbage. But it's hard to tell\nupfront what is worthless and what is valuable because attention is\nmoney so everything is marketing. Everything has a new coat of paint and\nhas been spritzed with perfume. What do we do when there are so many\nthings we could do, but it's hard to tell which are wastes of time? How\ndo we reduce the dimensionality of our options with so much noisy data?\nGratitude can help Gratitude can help us focus on what is valuable.\nBeing grateful for something implies a host of magnificent and healthy\nepistemic processes. For example, I'm grateful for my dog, Rosie. I'm\nparticularly grateful that she's acting less like a puppy and more like\na productive member of my family's household society. To tell you about\nmy gratitude for my dog's behavior, I had to first search through all\nsorts of things in my life I could tell you about. Rosie was easy to\nfind in this search process. However the algorithm works, it was\nefficient and accurate - it didn't take me long to come up with an\nexample and I'm certain about my feeling here. To articulate my\ngratitude, I then had to particularize Rosie as an object of my\nattention. Rosie is not an abstract concept or just an idea. She became\nan object in my attention with properties and characteristics that I can\ndescribe. In other words, I focused on her to the exclusion of anything\nelse. Once presented in my awareness, my relationship with her takes\ncenter stage. I'm grateful for her because of how we interact. Not just\nbecause of who she is or who I am, but because of who we are together.\nWe're correlated statistically. What I think is associated with who she\nis. We're coupled cybernetically. How she exists influences what I do.\nMy gratitude is about our existence together - a dynamic, fluid,\nabstract-yet-influential relationship that helps to direct my\nexperiences and actions over time.\n\n## Gratitude as signal of value \n\nRosie has helped me find what is valuable. My gratitude acted as both\nsearch and filter for finding something that has meaning to me. Easy,\nquick, accurate. It doesn't matter how many more things I add to search\nthrough, how much more content humanity produces, it will still be easy\nto identify her - and a host of other good things in my life - as\nsomething I'm grateful for. This salience in my focus, this worthiness\nof attention that gratitude produces is something I can only describe as\nmeaningful. It fills that epistemic moment with a sense of value.\nGratitude helps us find the signals of value in the noise of modern\nlife.\n\n## Gratitude as dimensionality reduction\n\nTo be grateful for Rosie, I also had to focus on her at the exclusion of\nanything else. There are many, perhaps uncountably infinite, things I\ncould be grateful for. There are also many, perhaps uncountably\ninfinite, ways that I could be grateful for Rosie. Relationships are\ndynamic, they change in quality over time. But from all of these\npossibilities, I could wrap my attention around a thing known as Rosie\nand describe her in a way that is comprehensible to you in just a few\nwords. I could envelop the intricate complexities of our relationship,\nan immaterial thing, to communicate the positive experience I take from\nit. Considering how Rosie and I can move through life together, there\nare yet infinitely more ways that we could act and interact, and yet my\ngratitude at where we've been suggest possible futures that are valuable\nand that would make me grateful anew. In sea of infinite options,\ngratitude has reduce the dimensions I must consider to help me reflect\non where I've been and chart a course for the future.\n\n## Gratitude in 2024 \n\nThis has been a meditation on part of life I find overwhelming. I want\nto do good stuff. I want to be good at the things I do. I want to have\nmeaningful relationships. I want to live my life well. Many and more are\nthe ways this could happen or could go wrong. There are so many dang\noptions for how to spend my time. I'm extremely grateful for my dog,\nobviously, as well as my family, friends, job, and God. Gratitude helps\nme slow down, find those things that are meaningful, and savor the good\ndynamics of those relationships. It also helps me to think about how to\nnourish those good things so they bloom into something beautiful. Being\ngrateful for what I've experience in 2023 helps me plan what to do in\n2024. I have goals, but gratitude suggests the purpose isn't to achieve\ngoals, it's to help what is true, beautiful, and good in my life\nflourish.\n",
